## General Accessories

The badge uses a USB-C to USB-C cable as the lanyard - any USB-C cable will do, we recommend one around a meter long but it's up to you! You can also use regular lanyards if you would prefer.

- [A glowing charging cable](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charger-Charging-iPhone-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0CSS8YZDZ/ref=sr_1_6): Note, that we do not recommend metal-shrouded usb cables as they can short circuits if they touch hexpansions.
