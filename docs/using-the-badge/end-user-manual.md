The Tildagon is a badge that you can wear around your neck. It has a round screen, six buttons, and lots of colourful LEDs. It has a USB-C connector, WiFi, and a battery. It can run MicroPython, and has six hexpansion connectors.

The badge will automatically connect to camp wifi, and you can use the app store to install apps.

The hexpansions that the badge supports allow you to extend the functionality of the badge with hardware made by other attendees.
