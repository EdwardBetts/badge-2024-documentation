The nodule may, but doesn't have to, provide an i2c-attached eeprom from a list of known parts. This eeprom can be a nodule identification/description, but it may also contain code, that the user of the badge will be able to run if they choose once the nodule has been inserted</li> <li>lots of gnd pins</li> </ul> <p>Nodules have a default hexagonal size and shape, but may extend outside the specified shape within documented constraints</p> <p>There will be mechanical mounting posts for nodules to attach to the baseboard with 2mm screws.
